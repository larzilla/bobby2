{"body":"### Code Cleaner\r\nThis tool removes characters that may interfer with rss syndication. These characters can also display as funky boxes in HTML emails.\r\n\r\n### URL Encoder\r\nThis form encodes or decodes a string using URL Encoding. URL Encoding is used when placing text in a query string to avoid it being confused with the URL itself. It is normally used when the browser sends form data to a web server. \r\n\r\n### One-Click Opt-in Link Creator\r\nThis form creates one-click opt-in links for email only. Currently, this tool uses the same information used on the Form Creator page in SigupApp but can be modified for use with other email systems. When using the links generated by this tool, do not track these links in Milo or Message Central.\r\n\r\n**How to test in Milo**\r\n\r\nAfter the link has been created, test by placing your email address over the section of the link that contains <%= :emailAddress %> . Then place the link in your browser's address bar and hit ENTER. You'll know the link works if you get the confirmation email in your inbox.\r\n\r\n**How to test in Message Central**\r\n\r\nAfter adding your content, click on the Preview tab. First put your email address into the input area next to Sample Recipient and click \"Refresh Preview\". Look up and place your email address into the box below the \"Send Test Email Message\". Click send. You should now be able to click on the link in your inbox and receive the optin message.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
